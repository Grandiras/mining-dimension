# Mining Dimension
Sick of strip-mining the Overworld for a handful of diamonds? Mining Dimension gives you a brand-new realm overflowing with resources. Every vanilla ore spawns at significantly higher rates, and—thanks to full Create integration—you’ll also uncover Zinc. Spend less time branch-mining and more time building contraptions!

## Key Features
- Super-rich generation: All vanilla ores spawn ~2-4 × more frequently than in the Overworld
- Create-ready: Includes generation layers for Zinc 
- Balanced height map: Diamond & Gold sit deep, while coal and copper are abundant near the ceiling.

## Ore Distribution

> The stripes' thickness is not to scale!
