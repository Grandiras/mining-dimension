> ⚠️ Requires Create mod to work! A vanilla-compatible version might be released in the future.

# Mining Dimension

Sick of strip-mining the Overworld for a handful of diamonds? Mining Dimension gives you a brand-new realm overflowing with resources. Every vanilla ore spawns at significantly higher rates, and—thanks to full Create integration—you’ll also uncover Zinc. Spend less time branch-mining and more time building contraptions!

## Key Features
- Super-rich generation: All vanilla ores spawn ~2-4 × more frequently than in the Overworld
- Create-ready: Includes generation layers for Zinc 
- Balanced height map: Diamond & Gold sit deep, while coal and copper are abundant near the ceiling.
Access

You can enter the Dimension with the command /execute in mining_dimension:mining_dimension run tp @s 0 128 0.

But be careful. This Datapack is made for Modpack Developer. Modpack Developers should develop a way to access it!
